# Crystal Collector
A game application which allows individuals to click on a certain crystal until the score is reached. At the beginning of each game, a random number is generated. If you go over the random number, you lose.

#### How to play

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, it will update the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
